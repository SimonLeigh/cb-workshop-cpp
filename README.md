### Day 2: Using the Couchbase C Client Library

The starting point for the day 2 execises is the 'TravelAppSample-Empty' application. This is basically an application skeleton which has:

* All the header files
* An empty implementation of the required methods
* Test/demo cases

The application 'TravelAppSample' then contains all the exercise solutions.

## Help

* Where can I find the View for 'airports/by_name'?

The View code can be found in the 'resources/views' sub-folder. You need to create a Design Document called 'airports' in your 'travel-sample' bucket. Then a View 'by_name' needs to created in this Design Document. You should test the View via the UI before doing the related exercise. 

* How to install the Sample Data?

In case that you didn't install the sample data together with Couchbase 4.x the following shows how to load it:

```
cbdocloader -u couchbase -p couchbase -n 127.0.0.1:8091 -b travel-sample -s 128 travel-sample.zip
```
